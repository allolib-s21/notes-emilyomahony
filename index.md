# Notes from Emily O'Mahony

[Python script for generating a chord progression](https://gist.github.com/emilyomahony/2a59a65ecd2efbdc75317a2705ba73fc)

Currently I'm working on a way to loop what's being played in the Allolib playground. Ideally this would be similar to an effects pedal, where the user could toggle on and off the recording and choose what gets looped. The time of the loop would also be variable. 

A very basic version of this is provided in the `src` directory.
